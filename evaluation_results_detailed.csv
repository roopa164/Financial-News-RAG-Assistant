What are the specific technical details of Apple's upcoming product launch scheduled for February 19?,"['Something\'s cooking in Cupertino. I\'m referring, of course, to Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which is based in Cupertino, California. Apple CEO Tim Cook all but told investors to circle their calendars for Wednesday, Feb. 19, 2025 in a recent social media post. The world\'s largest company by market cap is expected to make a big announcement on that date. Should you buy Apple stock hand over fist before Feb. 19? Adding to the Apple family Last week, Cook posted on X (formerly Twitter) that a key product launch was imminent. Unsurprisingly, he was cryptic about what the new product would be. What is the most likely candidate for Apple\'s ""newest member of the family?"" Probably the best bet is an updated version of the iPhone SE. It\'s the cheapest iPhone -- and the only one that still features a physical ""home"" button, and it\'s overdue for a refresh. There are other possibilities, though. Apple could be preparing to introduce a new MacBook Air. Additional alternatives include the next generation', 'Apple will unveil a product tomorrow, but Wall Street is already pretty sure what it is. Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook wrote, “Get ready to meet the newest member of the family,” in an X post last week. The post also said that there will be an Apple launch on Wednesday.

If the company was rolling out a game changer, it would almost certainly hold a major event to build the excitement. If the new member of the Apple family is indeed an updated version of iPhone SE, investors' reactions will likely be a yawn. The entry-level smartphone doesn't rank among the top sellers in the iPhone lineup. Story Continues Should you scramble to buy Apple stock? Back to our original question: Should you scramble to buy Apple stock before Feb. 19? The answer is an easy one: No. There's no reason, at this point, to think that Apple's new product launch this week will move the needle much for the company or the stock. However, whether or not you should buy Apple stock in the near term (but not necessarily before Wednesday's news) is a different question, and I don't think this question is easy to answer. There are three main knocks against investing in Apple."", 'be preparing to introduce a new MacBook Air. Additional alternatives include the next generation of AirTags, a new Apple-TV box, or a redesigned iPad Air Magic Keyboard. Maybe Apple will have multiple new product launches. However, Cook\'s tweet used the singular ""member,"" so it seems likely that the company will focus on only one product. Will the launch provide a big catalyst? New-product launches have sometimes caused Apple\'s share price to surge in the past, although the stock moves didn\'t always happen on the day of the announcement. For example, the company introduced the larger-screen iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus and the Apple Watch in September 2014. While Apple\'s share price didn\'t jump immediately, the stock rose by a double-digit percentage over the next two months. Will the new product announcement this week provide a big catalyst for Apple? There\'s no way to know for sure -- but probably not. For one thing, Apple appears to be only issuing a press release about this new', 'beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Story Continues Is Apple Inc.

However, media reports on direct discussions between TSMC and the US government are ""of questionable credibility,"" he adds, given that such matters typically require state-to-state engagement through Taiwan\'s government. Rajkumar also points to recent developments in US-Taiwan relations as a potential backdrop for the Intel-TSMC speculation.
